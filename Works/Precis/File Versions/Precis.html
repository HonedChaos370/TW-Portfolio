is offered that suggests the best way to work with the specific personality. &nbsp;Additionally, an &ldquo;overall goal&rdquo; is provided to summarize the strategy for dealing with this kind of person.</span></p><h1 class="c0" id="h.tc6g0h1ve99w"><span class="c1">Messmer</span></h1><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Conflict management from the perspective of the average coworker was discussed by Messmer. &nbsp;Different strategies to handle a difficult situation are first addressed. &nbsp;Ideas to mitigate the risk of future conflicts are proceeded. &nbsp;Thoughts regarding different ways to be a better coworker and how to generally think about conflicts follow these strategies. &nbsp;In summary, conflict management itself and preventative measures are broadly addressed by Messner. &nbsp;Addressing situations directly, sharing credit for group work, and using humor is also mentioned. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">A more conversational approach to conflict management is taken by Messmer. &nbsp;A casual discussion regarding how coworkers should go about their daily activities with slight changes is first presented. &nbsp;This is to ensure conflicts are handled appropriately and sometimes prevented according to Messmer. &nbsp;Humor in the workplace is one of the recommended ways to accomplish this. &nbsp;Humor is a tool that can be used to seem &ldquo;easy to work with&rdquo; and &ldquo;a welcome addition to the project team.&rdquo; Humor can help to relieve stress and motivate others around you.</span></p><h1 class="c0" id="h.9nhvw1p80cv6"><span class="c1">Potterton</span></h1><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Workplace issues and methods for dealing with them are addressed by Potterton and colleagues. &nbsp;How our world has and is constantly changing is first explained. &nbsp;World and life events can lead to employees feeling stress or anxiety. &nbsp;Through coordination between human resources, these situations can be minimized. &nbsp;When employees have the resources they need in addition to a healthy and diverse work environment, this suggests good management and human resources cooperation. &nbsp;General workplace advice such as reminding employees of human resource availability, ensuring managers set good examples, and being mindful of how the outside world will affect internal employees, are all great examples of what Potterton is trying to explain.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Management is different in today&rsquo;s world, as discussed by Potterton and colleagues. &nbsp;As an example, the 2016 presidential election is used. &nbsp;After the election, anxiety that coworkers may be deported was felt by many employees. &nbsp;These concerns were expressed in the employee assistance program (EAP) sessions. &nbsp;How the world affects employees is one goal of this example. &nbsp;Difficult workplace conversations and frustrations amongst employees who may feel uncomfortable conversing over sensitive topics, can all be the result of world events.</span></p><h1 class="c0" id="h.hd5wzlhj83h7"><span class="c1">Ramsey</span></h1><p class="c2"><span class="c3">How tension can build in the workplace is generally discussed by Ramsey. &nbsp;Specifically, the expectation of employees to constantly produce faster with fewer resources leads to natural frustration at times is addressed. &nbsp;Competition, perceived inequalities, grudges, comparisons, and many others are also addressed by Ramsey. &nbsp;There is an acceptable amount of conflict, but there is a point at which intervention is needed. &nbsp;General advice to remedy interpersonal conflicts is then provided. &nbsp;Encouraging self resolution, reducing competition, giving warnings, etc are strategies recommended by Ramsey. Taking sides, waiting too long, handling conflicts in public, and similar actions are all discouraged by Ramsey.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Ramsey&rsquo;s strategies to resolve conflicts are interesting as they present some new ideas and perspectives. &nbsp;Trying to relieve stress, pressure, and competition when acceptable is recommended. &nbsp;Essentially, rigidity may sometimes lead to interpersonal issues between employees. &nbsp;Specifically, relaxing deadlines, planning team-building activities, and promoting an enjoyable work environment can help to prevent issues. &nbsp;Recommended ideas referenced previously and more, such as recommending employees choose their words carefully, imposing cooling-off periods, and, in extreme cases, suggesting a resolution is needed to continue employment at the company all represent great ways to handle conflict management.</span></p><h1 class="c0" id="h.busc667gvwy8"><span class="c1">Rogers</span></h1><p class="c2"><span class="c3">A story from Rowan Salt to introduce the topic of conflict management in a new way is used by Rogers. &nbsp;A workplace in which a particular employee takes over all work interactions, making himself right in his own eyes is the story used as an example. &nbsp;All related coworkers seem to dislike this individual, making this a detrimental situation. &nbsp;Additionally, the workplace is overall less productive and efficient as a result. &nbsp;The lack of management intervention to address the root issue instead of the surface issue is discussed by Rogers. &nbsp;At the present time, the employee should be halted when necessary and other corrective actions taken as needed. &nbsp;Poor management in regards to managing such an employee is the primary reason for this issue. &nbsp;Laying out a plan that includes confronting the employee, regaining control of the situation, day-to-day activities, and finally reassuring the team that corrective steps have been taken are ideas discussed as Rogers continues. &nbsp;A final explanation of how this situation could be greatly improved by specific changes is how Rogers concludes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Rogers&rsquo; use of the case study format is very effective in that it provides a clear example of conflict management to begin a discussion about the topic. &nbsp;A very real situation that could happen in any type of workplace is depicted in this case study. &nbsp;With this in mind, a description of just how a difficult employee can very quickly create problems throughout the organization if left unchecked is further discussed. &nbsp;In this case, clearly a failure of management to address and correct the problem exists. &nbsp;Similarly, how easy it can be for situations like this to arise is shown by Rogers&rsquo; story.</span></p></div></body></html>
