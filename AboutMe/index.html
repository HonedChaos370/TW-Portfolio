                <p>
                    I am an aspiring product owner 
                    with a strong background in technical writing.
                    I am currently  a fulltime student at 
                    Southwest Baptist University in Bolivar, MO. 
                    I am majoring in Computer Information Science 
                    with a minor in Cybersecurity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, I works part-time in Bolivar 
                    at Duck Creek Technologies as a Support Engineer 
                    Intern.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whenever I am not working at my job or for 
                    a campus organization, I spend my time 
                    mentoring my peers in the computing 
                    department.
